2.1. Overview
The iCE40 UltraPlus family of ultra-low power FPGAs has three devices with densities ranging from 2,800 to 5,280
Look-Up Tables (LUTs) fabricated in a 40 nm Low Power CMOS process. In addition to LUT-based, low-cost
programmable logic, these devices also feature Embedded Block RAM (EBR), Single Port RAM (SPRAM), on-chip
Oscillators (LFOSC, HFOSC), two hardened I2C Controllers, two hardened SPI Controllers, PWM IP, three 24 mA RGB LED
open-drain drivers, I3C interface pins, and DSP blocks. These features allow the devices to be used in low-cost,
high-volume consumer and mobile applications.
The iCE40 UltraPlus FPGAs are available in very small form factor packages, as small as 2.11 mm × 2.54 mm. The small
form factor allows the device to easily fit into a lot of mobile applications, where space can be limited. Table 2.1 lists
the LUT densities, package and I/O pin count.
The iCE40 UltraPlus devices offer I/O features such as pull-up resistors. Pull-up features are controllable on a “per pin”
basis. In addition, the iCE40 UltraPlus devices offer two I/Os with dynamic control on the pull-up resistors to support
I3C interface.
The RGB PWM IP in the iCE40 UltraPlus devices provides controls for driving the 24 mA LED Sink driver, including color
controls, LED ON/OFF time, and breathe rate.
The iCE40 UltraPlus devices also provide flexible, reliable and secure configuration from on-chip NVCM. These devices
can also configure themselves from external SPI Flash, or be configured by an external master such as a CPU.
Lattice provides a variety of design tools that allow complex designs to be efficiently implemented using the iCE40
UltraPlus family of devices. Popular logic synthesis tools provide synthesis library support for iCE40 UltraPlus. Lattice
design tools use the synthesis tool output along with the user-specified preferences and constraints to place and route
the design in the iCE40 UltraPlus device. These tools extract the timing from the routing and back-annotate it into the
design for timing verification.

Figure 3.1. iCE40UP5K Device, Top View
The Programmable Logic Blocks (PLB) and sysMEM EBR blocks, are arranged in a two-dimensional grid with rows and
columns. Each column has either PLB or EBR blocks. The PIO cells are located at the top and bottom of the device,
arranged in banks. The PLB contains the building blocks for logic, arithmetic, and register functions. The PIOs utilize a
flexible I/O buffer referred to as a sysI/O buffer that supports operation with a variety of interface standards. The
blocks are connected with many vertical and horizontal routing channel resources. The place and route software tool
automatically allocates these routing resources.
In the iCE40 UltraPlus family, there are three sysI/O banks, one on top and two at the bottom. User can connect some
VCCIOs together, if all the I/Os are using the same voltage standard. See the Power-up Supply Sequence section. The
sysMEM EBRs are large 4 kb, dedicated fast memory blocks. These blocks can be configured as RAM, ROM or FIFO with
user logic using PLBs.
In addition to the EBR, the iCE40 UltraPlus devices also feature four 256 kb SPRAM blocks that can be cascaded to
create up to 1 Mb block. It is useful for temporary storage of large quantities of information.

Every device in the family has two user SPI ports, one of them (on the right side) also supports programming and
configuration of the device. The iCE40 UltraPlus also includes two user I2C ports, two oscillators, and high current RGB
LED sink.

3.1.1. PLB Blocks
The core of the iCE40 UltraPlus device consists of Programmable Logic Blocks (PLB) which can be programmed to
perform logic and arithmetic functions. Each PLB consists of eight interconnected Logic Cells (LC), as shown in
Figure 3.2. Each LC contains one LUT and one register.

Logic Cells
Each Logic Cell includes three primary logic elements shown in Figure 3.2.
• A four-input Look-Up Table (LUT) builds any combinational logic function, of any complexity, requiring up to four
inputs. Similarly, the LUT element behaves as a 16x1 Read-Only Memory (ROM). Combine and cascade multiple
LUTs to create wider logic functions.
• A ‘D’-style Flip-Flop (DFF), with an optional clock-enable and reset control input, builds sequential logic functions.
Each DFF also connects to a global reset signal that is automatically and immediately asserted following device
configuration.

If Set/Reset is not used, then the flip-flop is never set/reset, except when cleared immediately after configuration.

3.1.2. Routing
There are many resources provided in the iCE40 UltraPlus devices to route signals individually with related control
signals. The routing resources consist of switching circuitry, buffers and metal interconnect (routing) segments.
The inter-PLB connections are made with three different types of routing resources: Adjacent (spans two PLBs), x4
(spans five PLBs) and x12 (spans thirteen PLBs). The Adjacent, x4 and x12 connections provide fast and efficient
connections in the diagonal, horizontal and vertical directions.
The design tool takes the output of the synthesis tool and places and routes the design.

3.1.3. Clock/Control Distribution Network
Each iCE40 UltraPlus device has six global inputs, two pins on the top bank and four pins on the bottom bank.
These global inputs can be used as high fanout nets, clock, reset or enable signals. The dedicated global pins are
identified as Gxx and each drives one of the eight global buffers. The global buffers are identified as GBUF[7:0]. These
six inputs may be used as general purpose I/O if they are not used to drive the clock nets.
Table 3.2 lists the connections between a specific global buffer and the inputs on a PLB. All global buffers optionally
connect to the PLB CLK input. Any four of the eight global buffers can drive logic inputs to a PLB. Even-numbered global
buffers optionally drive the Set/Reset input to a PLB. Similarly, odd-numbered buffers optionally drive the PLB
clock-enable input. GBUF[7:6, 3:0] can connect directly to G[7:6, 3:0] pins respectively. GBUF4 and GBUF5 can connect
to the two on-chip Oscillator Generators (GBUF4 connects to LFOSC, GBUF5 connects to HFOSC).

Global Hi-Z Control
The global high-impedance control signal, GHIZ, connects to all I/O pins on the iCE40 UltraPlus device. This GHIZ signal
is automatically asserted throughout the configuration process, forcing all user I/O pins into their high-impedance
state.
Global Reset Control
The global reset control signal connects to all PLB and PIO flip-flops on the iCE40 UltraPlus device. The global reset
signal is automatically asserted throughout the configuration process, forcing all flip-flops to their defined wake-up
state. For PLB flip-flops, the wake-up state is always reset, regardless of the PLB flip-flop primitive used in the
application.

3.1.4. sysCLOCK Phase Locked Loops (PLLs)
The sysCLOCK PLLs provide the ability to synthesize clock frequencies. The iCE40 UltraPlus devices have one sysCLOCK
PLL. REFERENCECLK is the reference frequency input to the PLL and its source can come from an external I/O pin, the
internal Oscillator Generators from internal routing. EXTFEEDBACK is the feedback signal to the PLL which can come
from internal routing or an external I/O pin. The feedback divider is used to multiply the reference frequency and thus
synthesize a higher frequency clock output.
The PLLOUT output has an output divider, thus allowing the PLL to generate different frequencies for each output. The
output divider can have a value from 1 to 64 (in increments of 2X). The PLLOUT outputs can all be used to drive the
iCE40 UltraPlus global clock network directly or general purpose routing resources can be used.
The LOCK signal is asserted when the PLL determines it has achieved lock and de-asserted if a loss of lock is detected. A
block diagram of the PLL is shown in Figure 3.3.
The timing of the device registers can be optimized by programming a phase shift into the PLLOUT output clock which
advances or delays the output clock with reference to the REFERENCECLK clock. This phase shift can be either
programmed during configuration or can be adjusted dynamically. In dynamic mode, the PLL may lose lock after a phase
adjustment on the output used as the feedback source and not relock until the tLOCK parameter has been satisfied.
For more details, refer to iCE40 sysCLOCK PLL Design and Usage Guide (FPGA-TN-02052).

3.1.6. sysMEM Single Port RAM Memory (SPRAM)
The SPRAM block is implemented to be accessed only as a single port. Each block of SPRAM is designed to be 16K x 16
(256 kbits) in size. See Figure 3.5.
SPRAM Data Width
The SPRAM is designed with fixed 16-bit data width. However, the block contains nibble mask control on the write
input that allows the user logic to operate the SPRAM as x4 or x8 with this control on the write side. It also allows the
user logic to select which nibble/byte is in the read side.
SPRAM Initialization and ROM Operation
There is no pre-load into the SPRAM during device configuration. Therefore, the SPRAM is not initialized after
configuration.
SPRAM Cascading
Deeper SPRAM can be created using multiple SPRAM blocks, up to four blocks (64K x 16).
SPRAM Power Modes
There are three power modes in the SPRAM that the users can select during normal operation. This reduces the SPRAM
block power when it is not needed, allowing lower power consumption in an always-on application. These modes are:
• Standby Mode: SPRAM stops all activity, and SPRAM freezes in its current state. Memory contents are retained,
memory outputs are retained, and all register contents are retained.
• Sleep Mode: SPRAM block is shut down on all peripheral circuit, except the memory core. Memory contents are
retained, memory outputs and register contents are clear and become unknown.
• Power Off Mode: Power source to the SPRAM is disconnected. This is the lowest power state. Memory contents
are lost. Memory outputs are unknown.

3.1.8. sysI/O Buffer Banks
iCE40 UltraPlus devices have up to three I/O banks with independent V CCIO rails. The configuration SPI interface signals
are powered by SPI_VCCIO1. Refer to the
Pin Information Summary table.
Programmable I/O (PIO)
The programmable logic associated with an I/O is called a PIO. The individual PIOs are connected to their respective
sysI/O buffers and pads. The PIOs are placed on the top and bottom of the devices.

The PIO contains three blocks: an input register block, output register block iCEGate™ and tri-state register block. To
save power, the optional iCEGate™ latch can selectively freeze the state of individual, non-registered inputs within an
I/O bank. Note that the freeze signal is common to the bank. These blocks can operate in a variety of modes along with
the necessary clock and selection logic.
Input Register Block
The input register blocks for the PIOs on all edges contain registers that can be used to condition high-speed interface
signals before they are passed to the device core.
Output Register Block
The output register block can optionally register signals from the core of the device before they are passed to the
sysI/O buffers.
Figure 3.10 shows the input/output register block for the PIOs.

3.1.9. sysI/O Buffer
Each I/O is associated with a flexible buffer referred to as a sysI/O buffer. These buffers are arranged around the
periphery of the device in groups referred to as banks. The sysI/O buffers allow users to implement a wide variety of
standards that are found in today’s systems with LVCMOS interfaces.
Typical I/O Behavior During Power-up
The internal power-on-reset (POR) signal is deactivated when VCC, SPI_VCCIO1 and VPP_2V5 reach the level defined in
Table 4.4. After the POR signal is deactivated, the FPGA core logic becomes active. You must ensure that all VCCIO banks
are active with valid input logic levels to properly control the output logic states of all the I/O banks that are critical to
the application. The default configuration of the I/O pins in a device prior to configuration is tri-stated with a weak
pull-up to VCCIO. The I/O pins maintain the pre-configuration state until VCC, SPI_VCCIO1 and VPP_2V5 reach the defined
levels. The I/Os take on the software user-configured settings only after POR signal is deactivated and the device
performs a proper download/configuration. Unused I/Os are automatically blocked and the pull-up termination is
disabled.
Supported Standards
The iCE40 UltraPlus sysI/O buffer supports both single-ended input/output standards, and used as differential
comparators. The buffer supports input/output 1.8 V, 2.5 V, and 3.3 V standards, and LVCMOS 1.2 V standard output
only. The buffer has individually configurable options for bus maintenance (weak pull-up or none).
Table 3.9 and Table 3.10 show the I/O standards (together with their supply and reference voltages) supported by the
iCE40 UltraPlus devices.
Differential Comparators
The iCE40 UltraPlus devices provide differential comparator on pairs of I/O pins. These comparators are useful in some
mobile applications. Refer to the
Pin Information Summary section for the number of paired I/O available in each bank to implement differential
comparators. Refer to the device pinout file from the Lattice website for exact pin locations.

3.1.10. On-Chip Oscillator
The iCE40 UltraPlus devices feature two different frequency Oscillator. One is tailored for low-power operation that
runs at low frequency (LFOSC). Both Oscillators are controlled with internally generated current.
The LFOSC runs at nominal frequency of 10 kHz. The high frequency oscillator (HFOSC) runs at a nominal frequency of
48 MHz, divisible to 24 MHz, 12 MHz, or 6 MHz by user option. The LFOSC can be used to perform all always-on
functions, with the lowest power possible. The HFOSC can be enabled when the always-on functions detect a condition
that would need to wake up the system to perform higher frequency functions.

3.1.11. User I2C IP
The iCE40 UltraPlus devices have two I2C IP cores. Either of the two cores can be configured either as an I2C master or
as an I2C slave. The pins for the I2C interface are not pre-assigned. User can use any General Purpose I/O pins.
In each of the two cores, there are options to delay either the input or the output, or both, by 50 ns nominal, using
dedicated on-chip delay elements. This provides an easier interface with any external I2C components.
When the IP core is configured as master, it will be able to control other devices on the I2C bus through the
pre-assigned pin interface. When the core is configured as the slave, the device is able to provide I/O expansion to an
I2C Master. The I2C cores support the following functionality:
• Master and Slave operation
• 7-bit and 10-bit addressing
• Multi-master arbitration support
• Clock stretching
• Up to 400 kHz data transfer speed
• General Call support
• Optionally delaying input or output data, or both
• Optional filter on SCL input
For further information on the User I2C, refer to iCE40 SPI/I2C Hardened IP Usage Guide (FPGA-TN-02010).

3.1.12. User SPI IP
The iCE40 UltraPlus devices have two SPI IP cores. The pins for the SPI interface are not pre-assigned. User can use any
General Purpose I/O pins. Both SPI IP cores can be configured as a SPI master or as a slave. When the SPI IP core is
configured as a master, it controls the other SPI enabled devices connected to the SPI Bus. When SPI IP core is
configured as a slave, the device is able to interface to an external SPI master.
The SPI IP core supports the following functions:
• Configurable Master and Slave modes
• Full-Duplex data transfer
• Mode fault error flag with CPU interrupt capability
• Double-buffered data register
• Serial clock with programmable polarity and phase
• LSB First or MSB First Data Transfer
For further information on the User SPI, refer to iCE40 SPI/I2C Hardened IP Usage Guide (FPGA-TN-02010).

3.1.13. RGB High Current Drive I/O Pins
The iCE40 UltraPlus family devices offer multiple high current LED drive outputs in each device in the family to allow
the iCE40 UltraPlus product to drive LED signals directly on mobile applications.
There are three outputs on each device that can sink up to 24 mA current. These outputs are open-drain outputs, and
provides sinking current to an LED connecting to the positive supply. These three outputs are designed to drive the RBG
LEDs, such as the service LED found in a lot of mobile devices. This RGB drive current is user programmable from 4 mA
to 24 mA, in increments of 4 mA. This output functions as General Purpose I/O with open-drain when the high current
drive is not needed.

3.1.14. RGB PWM IP
To provide an easier usage of the RGB high current drivers to drive RGB LED, a Pulse-Width Modulator IP can be used in
the user design. This PWM IP provides the flexibility for user to dynamically change the modulation width of each of
the RGB LED driver, which changes the color. Also, the user can dynamically change the settings on the ON-time
duration, OFF-time duration, and ability to turn the LED lights on and off gradually with user set breath-on and
breath-off time.
For additional information on the PWM IP, refer to iCE40 LED Driver Usage Guide (FPGA-TN-02021).

3.1.15. Non-Volatile Configuration Memory
All iCE40 UltraPlus devices provide a Non-Volatile Configuration Memory (NVCM) block which can be used to configure
the device.
For more information on the NVCM, refer to iCE40 Programming and Configuration (FPGA-TN-02001).

3.2. iCE40 UltraPlus Programming and Configuration
This section describes the programming and configuration of the iCE40 UltraPlus family.

3.2.1. Device Programming
The NVCM memory can be programmed through the SPI port. The SPI port is located in Bank 1, using SPI_VCCIO1 power
supply.

3.2.2. Device Configuration
There are various ways to configure the Configuration RAM (CRAM), using SPI port, including:
• From a SPI Flash (Master SPI mode)
• System microprocessor to drive a Serial Slave SPI port (SSPI mode)
For more details on configuring the iCE40 UltraPlus, refer to iCE40 Programming and Configuration (FPGA-TN-02001).

3.2.3. Power Saving Options
The iCE40 UltraPlus devices feature iCEGate and PLL low power mode to allow users to meet the static and dynamic
power requirements of their applications. Table 3.11 describes the function of these features.
Table 3.11. iCE40 UltraPlus Power Saving Features Description
Device Subsystem
PLL
iCEGate

Feature Description
When LATCHINPUTVALUE is enabled, puts the PLL into low-power mode; PLL output held static at last
input clock value.
To save power, the optional iCEGate latch can selectively freeze the state of individual, non-registered
inputs within an I/O bank. Registered inputs are effectively frozen by their associated clock or
clock-enable control.

Notes:
•
Assumes monotonic ramp rates.
•
Power up sequence must be followed. See the Power-up Supply Sequence section below.

4.4. Power-On Reset
All iCE40 UltraPlus devices have on-chip Power-On-Reset (POR) circuitry to ensure proper initialization of the device.
Only three supply rails are monitored by the POR circuitry as follows: (1) V CC, (2) SPI_VCCIO1 and (3) VPP_2V5. All other
supply pins have no effect on the power-on reset feature of the device. Note that all supply voltage pins must be
connected to power supplies for normal operation (including device configuration).

4.5. Power-up Supply Sequence
It is recommended to bring up the power supplies in the following order. Note that there is no specified timing delay
between the power supplies, however, there is a requirement for each supply to reach a level of 0.5 V, or higher,
before any subsequent power supplies in the sequence are applied.
1.

VCC and VCCPLL should be the first two supplies to be applied. Note that these two supplies can be tied together
subject to the recommendation to include an RC-based noise filter on the VCCPLL. Refer to iCE40 Hardware Checklist
(FPGA-TN-02006).

2.

SPI_VCCIO1 should be the next supply, and can be applied any time after the previous supplies (V CC and VCCPLL) have
reached as level of 0.5 V or higher.

3.

VPP_2V5 should be the next supply, and can be applied any time after previous supplies (V CC, VCCPLL and SPI_VCCIO1)
have reached a level of 0.5 V or higher.

4.

Other Supplies (VCCIO0 and VCCIO2) do not affect device power-up functionality, and they can be applied any time
after the initial power supplies (VCC and VCCPLL) have reached a level of 0.5 V or greater. There is no power down
sequence required. However, when partial power supplies are powered down, it is required the above sequence to
be followed when these supplies are re-powered up again.

Note: To check the VSUPPLY(MIN) shown in Figure 4.1, please refer to the minimum recommended operation conditions in
the Recommended Operating Conditions section.

4.6. External Reset
When all power supplies have reached their minimum operating voltage defined in Table 4.2, it is required to either
keep CRESET_B LOW, or toggle CRESET_B from HIGH to LOW, for a duration of t CRESET_B, and release it to go HIGH, to
start configuration download from either the internal NVCM or the external Flash memory. Figure 4.1 shows Power-Up
sequence when SPI_VCCIO1 and VPP_2V5 are not connected together, and the CRESET_B signal triggers configuration
download. Figure 4.2 shows when SPI_VCCIO1 and VPP_2V5 are connected together. All power supplies should be
powered up during configuration. Before and during configuration, the I/Os are held in tri-state. I/Os are released to
user functionality once the device has finished configuration.

1. Input or I/O leakage current is measured with the pin configured as an input or as an I/O with the output driver tri-stated. It is
not measured with the output driver active. Internal pull-up resistors are disabled.
2. TJ 25 oC, f = 1.0 MHz.
3. Refer to VIL and VIH in Table 4.13.
4. Input pins are clamped to VCCIO and GND by a diode. When input is higher than VCCIO or lower than GND, the Input Leakage
current is higher than the IIL and IIH.

Assumes blank pattern with the following characteristics: all outputs are tri-stated, all inputs are configured as LVCMOS and
held at VCCIO or GND, on-chip PLL is off. For more detail with your specific design, use the Power Calculator tool. Power specified
with master SPI configuration mode. Other modes may be up to 25% higher.
•
Frequency = 0 MHz.
•
TJ = 25 °C, power supplies at nominal voltage, on devices processed in nominal process conditions.
•

2. Output clock is valid after tLOCK for PLL reset and dynamic delay adjustment.
3. At minimum fPFD. As the fPFD increases the time decreases to approximately 60% of the value listed.
4. Maximum limit to prevent PLL unlock from occurring. Does not imply the PLL operates within the output specifications listed in
this table.
